# Movie Collection Browser

A clean and interactive web application that allows users to browse through popular movie collections using data from The Movie DB (TMDB) API. This project was built as a technical demonstration for a job interview.

## Technical Note on "RecyclerView"

The term "RecyclerView" is native to Android development and prized for its memory efficiency. For this web-based task, I have interpreted its core principle as the requirement to **dynamically generate a list of UI elements from a data source**. This application demonstrates that pattern by fetching an array of movie data and mapping it to a grid of movie cards in the DOM.
